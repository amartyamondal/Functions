        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects rather than actions or logic. These objects represent real-world entities and are instances of classes, which define the structure and behavior of those objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?  \n",
        "   - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is like a blueprint or template for creating objects.\n",
        "\n",
        " 3.What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "   - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is a fundamental building block that represents a real-world entity or concept. An object is an instance of a class, and it bundles data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) together.\n",
        "\n",
        " 4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "    - Abstraction is about hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. *Encapsulation is about bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within one unit, and restricting direct access to some components.\n",
        "\n",
        " 5. What are dunder methods in Python?   \n",
        "    - In Python, dunder methods (short for “double underscore” methods, also known as magic methods) are special methods with names surrounded by double underscores, like init, str, or add.\n",
        "    They’re used to override or customize built-in Python behavior — such as object creation, string representation, operator overloading, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        " 6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "    - Inheritance is a feature of OOP that allows a class (called a child or subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (called a parent or superclass).\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism means “many forms”. In Object-Oriented Programming, it refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same method name in different ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?  \n",
        "   - In Python, encapsulation is achieved by restricting direct access to an object’s data and providing controlled access through methods. It’s all about protecting the internal state of an object from outside interference or misuse.\n",
        "\n",
        " 9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "    - A constructor in Python is a special method used to initialize a newly created object of a class. It sets up the object’s initial state by assigning values to its attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        " 10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "     - A class method is a method that is bound to the class, not the instance. It can access or modify class state (i.e., class variables) that applies across all instances. A static method is just like a regular function inside a class — it doesn’t take self or cls as the first argument. It can’t access or modify instance or class data directly. It's used when you want to group utility functions within a class for organizational purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "    - Method overloading is when you define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (number or type), and the correct one is chosen based on how it's called.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "    - Method overriding happens when a subclass (child class) provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass (parent class).\n",
        "\n",
        "Same method name\n",
        "\n",
        "Same parameters\n",
        "\n",
        "Different behavior\n",
        "\n",
        "It allows a subclass to customize or completely replace the behavior inherited from the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "    - The @property decorator allows you to:\n",
        "\n",
        "Access a method like an attribute (without parentheses)\n",
        "\n",
        "Add logic to get, set, or delete an attribute\n",
        "\n",
        "Create read-only, computed, or validated attributes\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "    -Polymorphism is super important in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) because it brings flexibility, extensibility, and cleaner code to the table.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "    - An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own. It's meant to be inherited by other classes, and it defines a common interface for all subclasses.\n",
        "It often includes abstract methods — methods that are declared but not implemented, forcing subclasses to provide their own implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "    - Awesome! Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) comes with a bunch of advantages that make software more organized, reusable, scalable, and easier to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "    - 1. Instance Variable Belongs to an object (instance) of the class\n",
        "Defined inside the constructor (init)\n",
        "Unique for each object\n",
        "Class Variable Belongs to the class itself, shared by all instances\n",
        "Defined outside of any method\n",
        "Changing it affects all objects, unless specifically overridden\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "   - Multiple inheritance means a class can inherit from more than one parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "This allows a subclass to combine features and behaviors from multiple base classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’str’ and ‘repr’ ‘ methods in Python\n",
        "    - Both are dunder methods (a.k.a. magic methods) used to define how your objects are represented as strings.\n",
        "\n",
        "Method Purpose Used by str For --> end-users (readable)--> print(), str() repr For -->developers (debuggable) -->repr(), interactive shell, logs\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "    - super() gives you access to methods and properties of a parent (superclass) without explicitly naming it. It’s commonly used in method overriding, especially in init.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the del method in Python?\n",
        "    - The del method in Python is a special (dunder) method that's called when an object is about to be destroyed, i.e., when it’s garbage collected.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "    - @staticmethod Does not take self or cls as the first argument.\n",
        "Takes cls (the class itself) as the first argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "    - olymorphism is one of the core pillars of OOP, and Python handles it gracefully thanks to its dynamic typing and inheritance system.\n",
        "\n",
        "24.What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "   - Method chaining is a slick and expressive coding style in Python — especially useful when working with object-oriented design.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the call method in Python?\n",
        "    - The call method allows an instance of a class to be called like a function.\n",
        "If a class defines call.\n",
